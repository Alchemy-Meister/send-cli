# send-cli
Unofficial command line (Firefox) Send client

Warning, Sharp Edges!
- overwriting any existing file without additional warning if you accept one as the download name
- uses a huge amount of memory when handling very large files
- your probably going to need to install at least pycryptodomex with pip3, sorry, i don't think its avoidable at the moment? (pycrypto only has AES GCM in a preview release, which i was using initially)
- No error handling, not even http status codes.
- not an exhaustive list, expect serious issues (such as data loss) if precautions are not taken

And plenty of missing features
- no ability to delete uploaded files (just need to print the delete token and add an option to send it)
- no progress information for encryption/transfer
- send urls MUST be quoted at the moment if the key contains "-" characters
- can't read from standard input nor write to standard output
- and more

Issues for bugs/features/mistakes/comments on coding style (using classes etc) are all very welcome, but pull requests more so ðŸ˜„
