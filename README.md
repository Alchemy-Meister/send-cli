# send-cli
Unofficial command line (Firefox) Send client

Warning, Sharp Edges!
- will overwrite the output file without warning, but does prompt for the output filename
- Uses temp files to avoid using large amount of memory, you will need at least 2GB of free disk space to upload a 2GB file
- your probably going to need to install at least pycryptodomex with pip3, sorry, i don't think its avoidable at the moment? (pycrypto only has AES GCM in a preview release, which i was using initially)
- Very limited error checking
- expect serious issues such as data loss if precautions are not taken (you are using a service where destroying your data is a feature, use common sense)

And plenty of missing features
- no ability to delete uploaded files (just need to print the delete token and add an option to send it)
- send urls MUST be quoted at the moment if the key contains "-" characters
- can't read from standard input nor write to standard output
- and more

Issues for bugs/features/mistakes/comments on coding style (using classes etc) are all very welcome, but pull requests even more so ðŸ˜„
